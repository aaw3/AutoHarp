# AutoHarp

[Archived Code] Program that reads pixel colors on your screen to play Hixel's Skyblock Melody's Harp for you.
This code requires a texture pack that will color the blocks that you click pure white white, however I no longer have the texture pack. The code must also be modified to match your resolution and GUI scale. The default currently supports 2560x1440, normal GUI scale.
